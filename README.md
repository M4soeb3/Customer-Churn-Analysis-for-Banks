Project: Predicting Customer Churn and Designing Retention Strategies
Description: Use a dataset of bank customers and develop a model to predict churn, along with strategies for retention.
Tasks to Include:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key factors contributing to churn.
Build a classification model (e.g., decision tree or logistic regression) to predict churn.
Conduct customer segmentation to identify high-risk groups.
Use A/B testing simulation to propose strategies (e.g., retention offers) and measure potential impact.
Skills Demonstrated: Data analysis, customer segmentation, predictive modeling, strategic thinking.
